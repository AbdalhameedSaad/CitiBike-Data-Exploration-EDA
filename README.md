## by Abdalhameed Saad


## Dataset

> Citi Bike is New York City’s bike share system, and the largest in the nation. Citi Bike launched in May 2013 and has become an essential part of transportation network. They make commute fun, efficient and affordable – not to mention healthy and good for the environment.

- Gender - (Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female)

> Where do Citi Bikers ride? When do they ride? How far do they go? Which stations are most popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on? Discovering the answers to these questions and more.

## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found out that the average duration for all trips is about 14.78 minutes and most trips were on Wednesdays and the male gender has the most trip over females.


> people between the age of 30 to 35 has more trips than other age in the disruption, and find that there are more than 87% of trips were taken by a subscriber.


> I found the birth year is 1969, from the exploration it is shown that there are more than 200000 customers whose ages are 51, this indicates that when a new customer takes a ride the default date of birth is set to 1969.


> Additionally, it can be seen that there is an increase in the number of trips for customers on holidays, which are Sunday and Monday, but on the other hand; the number of subscriber trips is decreasing on holidays.


> Those whose ages between 25 and 30 tend to have more time in the duration of the trip.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Throughout the presentation, I focus on the frequencies of rider gender and user type with the trip duration and leave out other variables. As a starting point, I examine trip frequencies by weekday and user gender.


> Afterwards, I ploted the user type distribution depending on weekday.



> In Multivariate Exploration, I plotted user type distributions based on user gender and trip duration, as well as user type distributions based on user weekday and trip duration 

>>The overall goals for the presentation is to show the following

- highlight the age range that has the most trips
- frequencies of rider gender and user type and the trip duration
- trip frequencies by weekday and usertype.
- user type distributions based on user gender and trip duration, as well as user type distributions based on user weekday and trip duration
- month that has the most trips
- the effect of weekday on the number of trips
